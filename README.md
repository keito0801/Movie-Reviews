This site is a review site where users can sign up with a username and and leave their own reviews for various movies. After logging in and selecting a movie a form is presented where a comment and rating can be selected and posted. After the review is instantly added to the sites databasse and viewable on the page. This site was made using Python and Django.

Some ideas for future improvements could include using an api for movie selections in order to give more options and make them easily updatable. Being able to more easily post and use data from the user for each movie would also be a way to improve the website. Changing the styling to make the pages and forms more visually appealing would also be a nice way to improve the site.
